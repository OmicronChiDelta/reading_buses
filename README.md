The Reading Buses Open Data API (https://rtl2.ods-live.co.uk/cms/) contains a large amount of data on historic and current movements of buses in the town of Reading, UK. 

This project explores various pieces of analysis using these datasets.

1) For a given service, which location served is associated with the greatest arrival time uncertainty?
Historic data on bus arrival times is available, as well as historic timetabling. Customers rely on timetables to plan their business, and therefore significant departures from expected arrival times directly impact their experience.
